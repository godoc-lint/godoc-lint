# This file serves as an example to explain various configuration parameters for
# Godoc-Lint.
#
# All keys are:
#  - Optional, unless stated otherwise.
#  - Assigned with their default value.
#

# Configuration file version.
version: "1.0"

# List of regexp patterns matching files the linter should include. When
# omitted/null, the linter includes all Go files. If assigned then only the
# files that their relative path (with respect to the config file path) matches
# any of the patterns will be processed.
#
# NOTE: The patterns must assume a Unix-like path (i.e., separated with forward
# slashes, `/`), even on Windows. This is to ensure a consistent behavior across
# different platforms.
#
# Example:
#   include:
#     - ^pkg/
#     - _foo.go$
include: null

# List of regexp patterns matching files the linter should skip. When
# omitted/null, the linter excludes no Go files. If assigned then only the
# files that their relative path (with respect to the config file path) does not
# match any of the patterns will be processed.
#
# NOTE: The patterns must assume a Unix-like path (i.e., separated with forward
# slashes, `/`), even on Windows. This is to ensure a consistent behavior across
# different platforms.
#
# Example:
#   exclude:
#     - ^internal/
#     - _autogenerated.go$
exclude: null

# Default set of rules to enable. Possible values are:
# - `basic`: enables basic rules which are: `pkg-doc`, `single-pkg-doc`, `start-with-name` and `deprecated`.
# - `all`:   all rules are enabled by default; the `disable` key can be used to disable specific rules.
# - `none`:  no rule is enabled by default; the `enable` key can be used to enable specific rules.
default: basic

# List of rules to enable *in addition to* the default set.
#
# See the linter docs for more on supported rules.

# Example:
#   - pkg-doc

#   - start-with-name
#   - require-doc
#   - deprecated
#   - require-stdlib-doclink
